package Beyonwiz::Hack::PutFile;

=head1 NAME

Beyonwiz::Hack::PutFile - insert a hack file in the Beyonwiz firmware

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Beyonwiz::Hack::PutFile;

A module to use as an argument to use with L< C<bw_patcher>|bw_patcher/>.
Copies a file into the required relative location in either the root or the
flash file system..

=head1 USE IN BW_PATCHER

    Beyonwiz::Hack::PutFile filesystem src_file dest_file dest_exec

The I<filesystem> argument is either C<root> or C<flash>
for the root file system (C</>) or the flash filesystem (C</flash>.
I<src_file> is the local pathname of the file to be inserted in the firmware
package,
I<dest_file> is the pathname of the file within the Beyonwiz
file system named in I<filesystem>.
If I<exec_file> is true, the file will be made executable
(execute permission set).

For example, to put local file C<myetcfile> into C</etc> on the Beyonwiz and
make it non-executable, use:

    Beyonwiz::Hack::PutFile root myetcfile etc/myetcfile 0

To put local file C<myhack> into C</flash/bin> on the Beyonwiz
and make it executable, use:

    Beyonwiz::Hack::PutFile flash myhack bin/myhack 1

The module will overwrite the firmware file if it already exists,
or create a new file if it doesn't.

This module is mainly intended for use by other
L< C<bw_patcher>|bw_patcher/>
modules, but it can be useful if you really know what you're doing.

=head1 DISABLING THE HACK

Download unmodified firmware into the Beyonwiz and
restart.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over

=item C<< hack($flash_dir, $root_dir, $filesystem, $src_file, $dest_file, $dest_exec) >>

Inserts C<$src_file> into the firmware filesystem
C<$filesystem> in the path C<$dest_file> relative
to the filesystem root.
Force C<$dest_file> to be executable if it doesn't already exist.

C<$filesystem> must be one of (B<root>, B<flash>).

The destination directory for the path must alteady exist in the firmware.
This is a bug.

=item C<< hackTag() >>

Returns C<bg> as the default suffix tag for the patch.

=head1 BUGS

B<Using user extensions or hacks may make your Beyonwiz unable to
operate correctly, or even start.
Some modifications are known to interfere with the correct
functioning of the Beyonwiz.>

If your Beyonwiz cannot start after you load modified firmware,
you may need to use the procedures in the
B<NOTICE - How to recover from FW update failure>
L<http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1298>
procedure on the Beyonwiz forum.
It's not known whether that procedure will fix all 
failures due to user modifications or "hacks".

If you run modified firmware on your Beyonwiz, and have
problems with its operation, try to reproduce
any problems you do have on a Beyonwiz running unmodified firmware,
or at least mention the modifications you use when reporting the
problem to Beyonwiz support or on the Beyonwiz Forum
L<http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/index.php>.
Beyonwiz support may not be able to assist if you are running anything
other than unmodified firmware from Beyonwiz.
Forum contributers may be able to be more flexible, but they will
need to know what modifications you have made.

The destination directory for the path must already exist in the firmware.
