package Beyonwiz::Hack::RemFile;

=head1 NAME

    Beyonwiz::Hack::RemFile - delete a file in the Beyonwiz firmware

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Beyonwiz::Hack::RemFile;

A module to use as an argument to use with L< C<bw_patcher>|bw_patcher/>.
Deletes a file at the given relative location in either the root or the
flash file system.

=head1 USE IN BW_PATCHER

    Beyonwiz::Hack::RemFile filesystem del_file

The I<filesystem> argument is either C<root> or C<flash>
for the root file system (C</>) or the flash filesystem (C</flash>.
I<del_file> is the pathname of the file within the Beyonwiz
file system named in I<filesystem>.

For example, to delete file C<rc.sysinit> in C</etc> on the Beyonwiz, use:

    Beyonwiz::Hack::RemFile root etc/rc.sysinit

To delete file C</flash/wizdvp/wizdvp> on the Beyonwiz, use:

    Beyonwiz::Hack::RemFile flash wizdvp/wizdvp

Don't actually download firmware patched with either of those examples.
The Beyonwiz will not start up, and will need the firmware recovery process
to get it working again.

This module is mainly intended for use by other
L< C<bw_patcher>|bw_patcher/>
modules, but it can be useful if you really know what you're doing.

=head1 DISABLING THE HACK

Download unmodified firmware into the Beyonwiz and
restart.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over

=item C<< hack($flash_dir, $root_dir, $filesystem, $file) >>

Deletes C<$file> from the firmware filesystem
C<$filesystem>, named relative to the filesystem root.

C<$filesystem> must be one of (B<root>, B<flash>).

=item C<< hackTag() >>

Returns C<bg> as the default suffix tag for the patch.

=back

=head1 PREREQUSITES

Uses packages
L<C<Beyonwiz::Hack::Utils>|Beyonwiz::Hack::Utils>.

=head1 BUGS

B<Using user extensions or hacks may make your Beyonwiz unable to
operate correctly, or even start.
Some modifications are known to interfere with the correct
functioning of the Beyonwiz.>

If your Beyonwiz cannot start after you load modified firmware,
you may need to use the procedures in the
B<NOTICE - How to recover from FW update failure>
L<http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1298>
procedure on the Beyonwiz forum.
It's not known whether that procedure will fix all 
failures due to user modifications or "hacks".

If you run modified firmware on your Beyonwiz, and have
problems with its operation, try to reproduce
any problems you do have on a Beyonwiz running unmodified firmware,
or at least mention the modifications you use when reporting the
problem to Beyonwiz support or on the Beyonwiz Forum
L<http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/index.php>.
Beyonwiz support may not be able to assist if you are running anything
other than unmodified firmware from Beyonwiz.
Forum contributers may be able to be more flexible, but they will
need to know what modifications you have made.
