=head1 BUGS

B<Using user extensions or hacks may make your Beyonwiz unable to
operate correctly, or even start.
Some modifications are known to interfere with the correct
functioning of the Beyonwiz.>

If your Beyonwiz cannot start after you load modified firmware,
you may need to use the procedures in the
B<NOTICE - How to recover from FW update failure>
L<http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1298>
procedure on the Beyonwiz forum.
It's not known whether that procedure will fix all 
failures due to user modifications or "hacks".

If you run modified firmware on your Beyonwiz, and have
problems with its operation, try to reproduce
any problems you do have on a Beyonwiz running unmodified firmware,
or at least mention the modifications you use when reporting the
problem to Beyonwiz support or on the Beyonwiz Forum
L<http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/index.php>.
Beyonwiz support may not be able to assist if you are running anything
other than unmodified firmware from Beyonwiz.
Forum contributers may be able to be more flexible, but they will
need to know what modifications you have made.
