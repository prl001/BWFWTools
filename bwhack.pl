=head1 NAME

bwhack - remotely enable and disable Beyonwiz "hacks"


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    bwhack [-H host|--host=host] [-p port|--port=port]
	   [-v|--verbose] [-h|help] [ hack1 on hack2 off ...]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Uses the presence and absence of files on the Beyonwiz HDD
to enable or disable various user extensions ("hacks") on the Beyonwiz
at startup time.

Must be used with a suitable C<rc.local> file installed
as executable in the Beyonwiz C</tmp/config>.
An example C<rc.local> is included in the
I<BWFWTools> package.

In order to get the file there in the first place,
Eric Fry's I<Telnet patch>
L<http://www.beyonwizsoftware.net/software-b28/telnet-firmware-patch>
can be used.
This only works on specific Beyonwiz firmware versions,
but once C<> is installed
on the Beyonwiz, it will not be removed
by firmware updates, only
by a Beyonwiz I<Factory Settings> reset.

Alternatively the C</etc/rc.sysinit> file in any
firmware distribution can be modified in a similar
way to the modification in I<Telnet patch>,
using L< C<unpack_wrp>|unpack_wrp/ >,
L< C<pack_wrp>|pack_wrp/ >
and a suitable editor.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The main arguments allow the known hacks to be enabled (C<on>)
or disabled (C<off>).

If no "hack" arguments are given, prints which are enabled and which
are disbled.

The known hacks are, in execution order:

=over 4

=item dim

The front panel display is run in a dimmer mode (as it is when on standby).

=item telnetd

Run I<telnetd> to allow login to the Beyonwiz using the I<telnet>
protocol.

=item wizremote

Enable Eric Fry's I<wizremote>
(L<http://www.beyonwizsoftware.net/software-b28/wizremote>)
on the Beyonwiz.

=item httproot

Enable HTTP access to whole BW.

The Beyonwiz root file system starts at
C<http://your_bw_ip_addr:49152/root>.
The Beyonwiz HTTP server doesn't allow directory
listing, so you have to know where you're navigating.

I<Httproot> does not work (but does not cause any apparent problems)
on firmware versions 01.05.271 (beta) and newer.
The C<ln> command has been removed from those firmware versions,
and without it the Beyonwiz cannot create the soft link
necessary to impement I<httproot>.

=item usb

Enable the use of hacks loaded from a USB drive or memory stick.
See L<C<Beyonwiz::Hack::USBHackSupport>|Beyonwiz::Hack::USBHackSupport>
for details.

=back

The options to I<bwhack> are:

=over 4

=item host

  --host=host
  -H host

Sets the host name or IP address of the Beyonwiz to connect to.

=item port

  --port=port
  -p port

Sets the IP port number of the Beyonwiz WizPnP/HTTP server
to connect to.
Must match the WizPnP port value set in C<<< SETUP>Network>WizPnP >>>
on the Beyonwiz.

=item verbose

  --verbose
  -v

Prints which hacks have been turned on or off.

=item help

  --help
  -h

Prints a summary of the command use.

=back

=head1 PREREQUSITES

Uses packages C<Getopt::Long>
and C<URI>,
C<LWP::Simple> and
C<HTTP::Request>.

=head1 BUGS

B<Using user extensions or hacks may make your Beyonwiz unable to
operate correctly, or even start.
Some modifications are known to interfere with the correct
functioning of the Beyonwiz.>

If your Beyonwiz cannot start after you load modified firmware,
you may need to use the procedures in the
B<NOTICE - How to recover from FW update failure>
L<http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1298>
procedure on the Beyonwiz forum.
It's not known whether that procedure will fix all 
failures due to user modifications or "hacks".

If you run modified firmware on your Beyonwiz, and have
problems with its operation, try to reproduce
any problems you do have on a Beyonwiz running unmodified firmware,
or at least mention the modifications you use when reporting the
problem to Beyonwiz support or on the Beyonwiz Forum
L<http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/index.php>.
Beyonwiz support may not be able to assist if you are running anything
other than unmodified firmware from Beyonwiz.
Forum contributers may be able to be more flexible, but they will
need to know what modifications you have made.

The hack names are displayed on the front panel as they execute.
Sometimes the last name will remain on the display until the
Beyonwiz overwrites it.
Changing channels will restore the dieplay to normal.

I<Httproot> does not work (but does not cause any apparent problems)
on firmware versions 01.05.271 (beta) and newer.
The C<ln> command has been removed from those firmware versions,
and without it the Beyonwiz cannot create the soft link
necessary to impement I<httproot>.

Requires a suitable startup procedure on the Beyonwiz
to work as intended.
The simplest way of adding one is to use

    bw_patcher.pl beyonwiz_firmware.wrp patched_firmware.wrp Beyonwiz::Hack::BwhackSupport
