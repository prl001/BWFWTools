NAME

    BWFW - Perl package of support routines for uncompressed Beyonwiz kernel
    images.

SYNOPSIS

        use BWFW;
    
    or

        use BWFW qw(
                        BASE
                        sym_val
                        check_magics
                        read_or_die
                        write_or_die
                        get_words
                        get_words_sym
                        get_str
                    );

CONSTANTS

    "BASE"
        The memory address corresponding to the start of the kernel image
        file. For Beyonwiz DP series PVRs, 0x90090000. This is 64kB higher
        than the start of memory at 0x90080000.

FUNCTIONS

    "sym_val($sym)"
        Looks up $sym in an internal table, and returns the address of a
        word in the kernel that contains the symbol value. Fatal error if
        the symbol is not defined.

        Recognised symbols are:

            DRAM_BASE         Start of RAM (0x90080000)
            _stext            Start of kernel code, or text segment (same as BASE)
            _text             Start of main kernel code after initialisation code
            _etext            End of kernel code, or text segment
            _edata            Start of initialised data segment
            __bss_start       Start of uninitialised data, or bss, segment
            _end              End of uninitialised data, or bss, segment, and end of kernel
            __start___ksymtab Start of the kernel module symbol table
            __stop___ksymtab  End of the kernel module symbol table
            rootROMFS         Start of the embedded ROMFS root file system (in initialised data segment)

    "get_words($fh, $addr, $n)"
        In an array context, returns an array of $n words (32-bit integers)
        commencing at Beyonwiz memory address $addr in the uncompressed
        Beyonwiz kernel image referenced by the file handle reference $fh.
        In a scalar context, returns the first element of the array, so

            $val = get_words($fh, $addr, 1);

        will work as expected.

        The words will be translated from the kernel image's little-endian
        order to the native order of the machine running the perl script.

    "get_words_sym($fh, $sym, $n)"
        Looks up $sym in an internal table, and uses the symbol's location
        as the $addr and returns the result of "get_words($fh, $addr, $n)".

        Equivalent to (and implemented as)

            get_words($fh, sym_val($sym), $n);

        Typical use is as

            get_words_sym($fh, 'symname', 1)

        to return the value of the symbol.

    "get_str($fh, $addr)"
        Returns a a null-terminated ASCII string starting ar commencing at
        Beyonwiz memory address $addr in the uncompressed Beyonwiz kernel
        image referenced by the file handle reference $fh.

        The maximum string length that can be returned is 1024 bytes. This
        probably should be a parameter, or made unlimited.

    "read_or_die($fn, $fh, $loc, $buf, $n, $die)"
        Seek to $loc in file handle reference $fh, and read $n bytes into
        the reference $buf. $fn is the file name associated with $fh, and is
        only used for error messages.

        Fatal error on I/O error, short read or end-of-file if $die is true,
        otherwise returns false on these conditions.

        Returns true on success.

    "write_or_die($fn, $fh, $loc, $buf, $n, $die)"
        Seek to $loc in file handle reference $fh, and write $n bytes into
        the file from reference $buf. $fn is the file name associated with
        $fh, and is only used for error messages.

        Fatal error on I/O error or short write if $die is true, otherwise
        returns false on these conditions.

        Returns true on success.

    "check_magics($kern_fn, $kern_fh)"
        Checks context information in the internal symbol location table
        (mostly the instructions that reference the pointers in the kernel
        that contain the symbol values) to verify that the symbol locations
        in the table are correct.

        The kernel is referenced by the file handle reference $fh. $fn is
        the kernel file name, used only for error messages.

        Also checks that

            get_words_sym($kern_fh, '_stext', 1) == BASE

        To ensure that the kernel commences at the expected location.

        Fatal error if the checks fail.
