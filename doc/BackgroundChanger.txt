NAME

    Beyonwiz::Hack::BackgroundChanger - hack Beyonwix screen background

SYNOPSIS

        Beyonwiz::Hack::BackgroundChanger;

    A module to use as an argument to use with "bw_patcher". It modifies the
    firmware to display a different background image in the full-screen
    menus.

    The image file must be a JPEG image, 1280x720 pixels for Beyonwiz
    firmware 01.05.247 and earlier.

    For firmware versions after 01.05.247, the image file must be a PNG
    image, 1280x720 pixels. The Beyonwiz then simply adds the constant GUI
    colour to that image, so greyscale images will probably come out best.
    The maximum intensity of each pixel in the image needs to be limited,
    otherwise the colour values can wrap around after adding the GUI
    colouring and you get weird effects. The image in the original firmware
    has no pixel with RGB values greater than (103, 103, 103) decimal (0x67,
    0x67, 0x67). The Beyonwiz base image is greyscale, but it has a colour
    map, so it's possible that coloured colour mapped images may also work.

DISABLING THE HACK

    Download unmodified firmware into the Beyonwiz and restart.

FUNCTIONS

    "hack($flash_dir, $root_dir, $image_file)"
        Inserts $image_file into the firmware instead of the default
        "wizdvp/guidata/bitmaps/wiz/total_image/Main-image-1.jpg"

    "hackTag()"
        Returns "bg" as the default suffix tag for the patch.

PREREQUSITES

    Uses packages "Image::Size", "Beyonwiz::Hack::PutFile"
    "Beyonwiz::Hack::RemFile" .

BUGS

    Using user extensions or hacks may make your Beyonwiz unable to operate
    correctly, or even start. Some modifications are known to interfere with
    the correct functioning of the Beyonwiz.

    If your Beyonwiz cannot start after you load modified firmware, you may
    need to use the procedures in the NOTICE - How to recover from FW update
    failure <http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1298>
    procedure on the Beyonwiz forum. It's not known whether that procedure
    will fix all failures due to user modifications or "hacks".

    If you run modified firmware on your Beyonwiz, and have problems with
    its operation, try to reproduce any problems you do have on a Beyonwiz
    running unmodified firmware, or at least mention the modifications you
    use when reporting the problem to Beyonwiz support or on the Beyonwiz
    Forum <http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/index.php>. Beyonwiz support
    may not be able to assist if you are running anything other than
    unmodified firmware from Beyonwiz. Forum contributers may be able to be
    more flexible, but they will need to know what modifications you have
    made.
