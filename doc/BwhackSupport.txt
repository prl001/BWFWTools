NAME

    Beyonwiz::Hack::BwhackSupport - support remote-controllable Beyonwiz
    function hacks

SYNOPSIS

        Beyonwiz::Hack::BwhackSupport;

    A module to use as an argument to use with "bw_patcher". It modifies the
    firmware to start a user-selectable set of hacks that can be
    enabled/disabled using "bwhack".

    Not suitable for use on a Beyonwiz DP-H1. See "BUGS".

    Not designed for use in combination with
    "Beyonwiz::Hack::USBHackSupport". However, the "usb" hack that can be
    enabled through this firmware patch contains all the functionality of
    "Beyonwiz::Hack::USBHackSupport".

    The hacks available for enabling (default is all disabled) are, in
    execution order:

    dim The front panel display is run in a dimmer mode (as it is when on
        standby).

    telnetd
        Run *telnetd* to allow login to the Beyonwiz using the *telnet*
        protocol.

    wizremote
        Enable Eric Fry's *wizremote*
        (<http://www.beyonwizsoftware.net/software-b28/wizremote>) on the
        Beyonwiz.

    httproot
        Enable HTTP access to whole BW.

        The Beyonwiz root file system starts at
        "http://your_bw_ip_addr:49152/root". The Beyonwiz HTTP server
        doesn't allow directory listing, so you have to know where you're
        navigating.

        This hack is not available on firmware versions 01.05.271 (beta) and
        later. See "bwhack" for details.

    usb Enable the use of hacks loaded from a USB drive or memory stick. See
        "Beyonwiz::Hack::USBHackSupport" for details.

    The installation process modifies the Beyonwiz firmware startup script
    "/etc/rc.sysinit" to copy the added firmware file "/flash/opt/rc.local"
    and "/flash/opt/usb.local" into "/tmp/config" each time the Beyonwiz
    starts. "/tmp/config/rc.local" and "/tmp/config/usb.local" are also
    copied into, and restored from, non-volatile storage each time the
    Beyonwiz restarts. "/etc/rc.sysinit" runs after this copy, so
    modifications to "/tmp/config/rc.local" will be overwritten each time
    the Beyonwiz starts (and before "/tmp/config/rc.local" has been run).
    However, this means that even if you install an unmodified firmware
    package on the beyonwiz, the patch will still be active, because running
    "/tmp/config/rc.local" is part of normal firmware startup.

    If the "usb" hack is enabled by "bwhack", "/tmp/config/usb.local" is run
    from "/tmp/config/rc.local" to implement the ability to run hacks from a
    USB drive (or memory card on an S1 or P1). See
    "Beyonwiz::Hack::USBHackSupport" for details.

    The effect of this hack will *not* be undone if you load unmodified
    firmware onto the Beyonwiz.

DISABLING THE HACK

    If the Beyonwiz is not running an unmodified firmware package, download
    unmodified firmware into the Beyonwiz and restart.

    Then, either:

    1   Enable only the "telnet" hack using "bwhack" (installing unmodified
        firmware has not disabled the hacks):

            bwhack.pl --host=my.BW.IP.addr all off
            bwhack.pl --host=my.BW.IP.addr telnetd on

    2   Connect to the Beyonwiz using "telnet".

    3   When you see the "#" command prompt, type

            rm /tmp/config/rc.local /tmp/config/usb.local /tmp/mnt/idehdd/telnetd
            exit

    or:

    1   If they're not enabled already, enable USB hacks by running:

            bwhack.pl --host=my.BW.IP.addr usb on

        then restarting the Beyonwiz.

    2   Then use the "S99removehacks" in "Beyonwiz::Hack::USBHackSupport" my
        copying it into "beyonwiz/etc/init.d" on a USB stick or memory card,
        connecting it to the Beyonwiz, and restart it. "S99removehacks" will
        remove all the files installed by this installer.

    Then restart the Beyonwiz (again, if you used the c<usb> hack).

FUNCTIONS

    "hack($flash_dir, $root_dir)"
        Called by "bw_patcher" to perform the patch.

        Inserts the lines:

            if [ -x /flash/opt/rc.local ]; then
                rm -f ${CONFIG_DIR}/rc.local
                cp /flash/opt/rc.local ${CONFIG_DIR}/rc.local
            fi
            if [ -x /flash/opt/usb.local ]; then
                rm -f ${CONFIG_DIR}/usb.local
                cp /flash/opt/usb.local ${CONFIG_DIR}/usb.local
            fi

        into the file that will be "/etc/rc.sysinit", the system startup
        script, on the Beyonwiz. The line will be inserted just before the
        comment line:

            # rc.local

        It also adds the new files "/flash/opt/rc.local" and
        "/flash/opt/usb.local" to the firmware. These files are copied into
        place in <C/tmp/config> to implement the hack.

    "hackTag()"
        Returns "bwhack" as the default suffix tag for the patch.

    "printHack()"
        Prints the file that would be installed as "/tmp/config/rc.local" by
        this installer.

        It can be run standalone as:

            perl -MBeyonwiz::Hack::USBHackSupport -e "Beyonwiz::Hack::USBHackSupport::printHack()"

        You can similarly print the file that would be installed as
        "/tmp/config/usb.local" by running:

        perl -MBeyonwiz::Hack::USBHackSupport -e
        "Beyonwiz::Hack::USBHackSupport::printHack()"

PREREQUSITES

    Uses packages "File::Spec::Functions", "File::Path",
    "Beyonwiz::Hack::USBHackSupport" "Beyonwiz::Hack::Utils".

BUGS

    Using user extensions or hacks may make your Beyonwiz unable to operate
    correctly, or even start. Some modifications are known to interfere with
    the correct functioning of the Beyonwiz.

    If your Beyonwiz cannot start after you load modified firmware, you may
    need to use the procedures in the NOTICE - How to recover from FW update
    failure <http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1298>
    procedure on the Beyonwiz forum. It's not known whether that procedure
    will fix all failures due to user modifications or "hacks".

    If you run modified firmware on your Beyonwiz, and have problems with
    its operation, try to reproduce any problems you do have on a Beyonwiz
    running unmodified firmware, or at least mention the modifications you
    use when reporting the problem to Beyonwiz support or on the Beyonwiz
    Forum <http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/index.php>. Beyonwiz support
    may not be able to assist if you are running anything other than
    unmodified firmware from Beyonwiz. Forum contributers may be able to be
    more flexible, but they will need to know what modifications you have
    made.

    This firmware hack will not work on a DP-H1 (nothing bad will happen to
    the DP-H1, you just won't be able to enable the hacks), but if you do
    install it, it's not straight-forward to remove.

    The hack names are displayed on the front panel as they execute.
    Sometimes the last name will remain on the display until the Beyonwiz
    overwrites it. Changing channels will restore the dieplay to normal.
