    into the required relative location in either the root or the flash file
    system..

DISABLING THE HACK

    Download unmodified firmware into the Beyonwiz and restart.

FUNCTIONS

    "hack($flash_dir, $root_dir, $filesystem, $src_file, $dest_file,
    $dest_exec)"
        Inserts $src_file into the firmware filesystem $filesystem in the
        path $dest_file relative to the filesystem root. Force $dest_file to
        be executable if it doesn't already exist.

        $filesystem must be one of (root, flash).

        The destination directory for the path must alteady exist in the
        firmware. This is a bug.

        Returns "bg" as the default suffix tag for the patch.

PREREQUSITES

    Uses packages "Beyonwiz::Hack::Utils".

BUGS

    Using user extensions or hacks may make your Beyonwiz unable to operate
    correctly, or even start. Some modifications are known to interfere with
    the correct functioning of the Beyonwiz.

    If your Beyonwiz cannot start after you load modified firmware, you may
    need to use the procedures in the NOTICE - How to recover from FW update
    failure <http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1298>
    procedure on the Beyonwiz forum. It's not known whether that procedure
    will fix all failures due to user modifications or "hacks".

    If you run modified firmware on your Beyonwiz, and have problems with
    its operation, try to reproduce any problems you do have on a Beyonwiz
    running unmodified firmware, or at least mention the modifications you
    use when reporting the problem to Beyonwiz support or on the Beyonwiz
    Forum <http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/index.php>. Beyonwiz support
    may not be able to assist if you are running anything other than
    unmodified firmware from Beyonwiz. Forum contributers may be able to be
    more flexible, but they will need to know what modifications you have
    made.

    The destination directory for the path must alteady exist in the
    firmware.
