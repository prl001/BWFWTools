NAME

    Beyonwiz::Hack::PutFile - insert a hack file in the Beyonwiz firmware

SYNOPSIS

        Beyonwiz::Hack::PutFile;

    A module to use as an argument to use with "bw_patcher". Copies a file
    into the required relative location in either the root or the flash file
    system..

USE IN BW_PATCHER

        Beyonwiz::Hack::PutFile filesystem src_file dest_file dest_exec

    The *filesystem* argument is either "root" or "flash" for the root file
    system ("/") or the flash filesystem ("/flash". *src_file* is the local
    pathname of the file to be inserted in the firmware package, *dest_file*
    is the pathname of the file within the Beyonwiz file system named in
    *filesystem*. If *exec_file* is true, the file will be made executable
    (execute permission set).

    For example, to put local file "myetcfile" into "/etc" on the Beyonwiz
    and make it non-executable, use:

        Beyonwiz::Hack::PutFile root myetcfile etc/myetcfile 0

    To put local file "myhack" into "/flash/bin" on the Beyonwiz and make it
    executable, use:

        Beyonwiz::Hack::PutFile flash myhack bin/myhack 1

    The module will overwrite the firmware file if it already exists, or
    create a new file if it doesn't.

    This module is mainly intended for use by other "bw_patcher" modules,
    but it can be useful if you really know what you're doing.

DISABLING THE HACK

    Download unmodified firmware into the Beyonwiz and restart.

FUNCTIONS

    "hack($flash_dir, $root_dir, $filesystem, $src_file, $dest_file,
    $dest_exec)"
        Inserts $src_file into the firmware filesystem $filesystem in the
        path $dest_file relative to the filesystem root. Force $dest_file to
        be executable if it doesn't already exist.

        $filesystem must be one of (root, flash).

        The destination directory for the path must alteady exist in the
        firmware. This is a bug.

    "hackTag()"
        Returns "bg" as the default suffix tag for the patch.

PREREQUSITES

    Uses packages "Beyonwiz::Hack::Utils".

BUGS

    Using user extensions or hacks may make your Beyonwiz unable to operate
    correctly, or even start. Some modifications are known to interfere with
    the correct functioning of the Beyonwiz.

    If your Beyonwiz cannot start after you load modified firmware, you may
    need to use the procedures in the NOTICE - How to recover from FW update
    failure <http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1298>
    procedure on the Beyonwiz forum. It's not known whether that procedure
    will fix all failures due to user modifications or "hacks".

    If you run modified firmware on your Beyonwiz, and have problems with
    its operation, try to reproduce any problems you do have on a Beyonwiz
    running unmodified firmware, or at least mention the modifications you
    use when reporting the problem to Beyonwiz support or on the Beyonwiz
    Forum <http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/index.php>. Beyonwiz support
    may not be able to assist if you are running anything other than
    unmodified firmware from Beyonwiz. Forum contributers may be able to be
    more flexible, but they will need to know what modifications you have
    made.

    The destination directory for the path must already exist in the
    firmware.
