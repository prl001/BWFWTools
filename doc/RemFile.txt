NAME

        Beyonwiz::Hack::RemFile - delete a file in the Beyonwiz firmware

SYNOPSIS

        Beyonwiz::Hack::RemFile;

    A module to use as an argument to use with "bw_patcher". Deletes a file
    at the given relative location in either the root or the flash file
    system.

USE IN BW_PATCHER

        Beyonwiz::Hack::RemFile filesystem del_file

    The *filesystem* argument is either "root" or "flash" for the root file
    system ("/") or the flash filesystem ("/flash". *del_file* is the
    pathname of the file within the Beyonwiz file system named in
    *filesystem*.

    For example, to delete file "rc.sysinit" in "/etc" on the Beyonwiz, use:

        Beyonwiz::Hack::RemFile root etc/rc.sysinit

    To delete file "/flash/wizdvp/wizdvp" on the Beyonwiz, use:

        Beyonwiz::Hack::RemFile flash wizdvp/wizdvp

    Don't actually download firmware patched with either of those examples.
    The Beyonwiz will not start up, and will need the firmware recovery
    process to get it working again.

    This module is mainly intended for use by other "bw_patcher" modules,
    but it can be useful if you really know what you're doing.

DISABLING THE HACK

    Download unmodified firmware into the Beyonwiz and restart.

FUNCTIONS

    "hack($flash_dir, $root_dir, $filesystem, $file)"
        Deletes $file from the firmware filesystem $filesystem, named
        relative to the filesystem root.

        $filesystem must be one of (root, flash).

    "hackTag()"
        Returns "bg" as the default suffix tag for the patch.

PREREQUSITES

    Uses packages "Beyonwiz::Hack::Utils".

BUGS

    Using user extensions or hacks may make your Beyonwiz unable to operate
    correctly, or even start. Some modifications are known to interfere with
    the correct functioning of the Beyonwiz.

    If your Beyonwiz cannot start after you load modified firmware, you may
    need to use the procedures in the NOTICE - How to recover from FW update
    failure <http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1298>
    procedure on the Beyonwiz forum. It's not known whether that procedure
    will fix all failures due to user modifications or "hacks".

    If you run modified firmware on your Beyonwiz, and have problems with
    its operation, try to reproduce any problems you do have on a Beyonwiz
    running unmodified firmware, or at least mention the modifications you
    use when reporting the problem to Beyonwiz support or on the Beyonwiz
    Forum <http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/index.php>. Beyonwiz support
    may not be able to assist if you are running anything other than
    unmodified firmware from Beyonwiz. Forum contributers may be able to be
    more flexible, but they will need to know what modifications you have
    made.
