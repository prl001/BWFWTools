NAME

        Beyonwiz::Hack::Telnet;

SYNOPSIS

    A module to use as an argument to use with "bw_patcher" to patch
    Beyonwiz firmware to start "telnetd" at startup to allow telnet
    connections to the Beyonwiz.

    The effect of this hack will be undone if you load unmodified firmware
    onto the Beyonwiz.

FUNCTIONS

    "hack($flash_dir, $root_dir)"
        Called by "bw_patcher" to perform the patch.

            telnetd -l /bin/sh &

        into the file that will be "/etc/rc.sysinit", the system startup
        script, on the Beyonwiz. The line will be inserted just before the
        comment line:

            # rc.local

DISABLING THE HACK

    Simply download unmodified firmware into the Beyonwiz and restart.

PREREQUSITES

    Uses packages "Beyonwiz::Hack::Utils".

BUGS

    Using *bw_patcher* (or any other method) to create a modified version of
    the firmware for any Beyonwiz model can result in a firmware package
    that can cause the Beyonwiz firmware to fail completely.
