NAME

    Beyonwiz::Hack::Telnet - hack to enable telnet access on the Beyonswz

SYNOPSIS

        Beyonwiz::Hack::Telnet;

    A module to use as an argument to use with "bw_patcher" to patch
    Beyonwiz firmware to start "telnetd" at startup to allow telnet
    connections to the Beyonwiz.

    The effect of this hack will be undone if you load unmodified firmware
    onto the Beyonwiz.

FUNCTIONS

    "hack($flash_dir, $root_dir)"
        Called by "bw_patcher" to perform the patch.

        Inserts the line:

            telnetd -l /bin/sh &

        into the file that will be "/etc/rc.sysinit", the system startup
        script, on the Beyonwiz. The line will be inserted just before the
        comment line:

            # rc.local

    "hackTag()"
        Returns "telnet" as the default suffix tag for the patch.

DISABLING THE HACK

    Simply download unmodified firmware into the Beyonwiz and restart.

PREREQUSITES

    Uses packages "Beyonwiz::Hack::Utils".

BUGS

    Using user extensions or hacks may make your Beyonwiz unable to operate
    correctly, or even start. Some modifications are known to interfere with
    the correct functioning of the Beyonwiz.

    If your Beyonwiz cannot start after you load modified firmware, you may
    need to use the procedures in the NOTICE - How to recover from FW update
    failure <http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1298>
    procedure on the Beyonwiz forum. It's not known whether that procedure
    will fix all failures due to user modifications or "hacks".

    If you run modified firmware on your Beyonwiz, and have problems with
    its operation, try to reproduce any problems you do have on a Beyonwiz
    running unmodified firmware, or at least mention the modifications you
    use when reporting the problem to Beyonwiz support or on the Beyonwiz
    Forum <http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/index.php>. Beyonwiz support
    may not be able to assist if you are running anything other than
    unmodified firmware from Beyonwiz. Forum contributers may be able to be
    more flexible, but they will need to know what modifications you have
    made.
