NAME

    Beyonwiz::Hack::USBHackSupport - hack to allow hacks to be run from a
    USB device

SYNOPSIS

        Beyonwiz::Hack::USBHackSupport;

    A module to use as an argument to use with "bw_patcher". It modifies the
    firmware to start hack scripts that are in the directory
    "beyonwiz/etc/init.d" any USB device connected at startup. If no such
    USB device is connected at startup no hacks will be started.

    Memory cards in the front slots on the DP-S1 count as connected USB
    devices, so memory cards as well as USB thumb and hard drives can be
    used to enable hacks this way.

    Not designed for use in combination with
    "Beyonwiz::Hack::BwhackSupport". However,
    "Beyonwiz::Hack::USBHackSupport" offers all the functionality available
    through "Beyonwiz::Hack::BwhackSupport", except "httproot", and unlike
    that patch, will work on the DP-H1.

    The hacks available for enabling (default is all disabled) are:

    S00enablevfd
        Enables display of progress through the hack startup on the front
        panel VFD (Vacuum Fluorescent Display).

    S01dimvfd
        The front panel display is run in a dimmer mode (as it is when on
        standby).

    S02telnet
        Run *telnetd* to allow login to the Beyonwiz using the *telnet*
        protocol.

    S08recfixer
        A version of tonymy01's *Error loading media file* fixer. Copies a
        "stat" file from an existing recording into recordings that are
        missing them, so that they become playable again. Unlike tonymy01's
        version, which only repairs recordings on the DP-S1 and DP-P1
        internal drive, this version will also look on any "registered for
        recording" drive on any Beyonwiz model and repair recordings there.

    S09wizremote
        Starts Eric Fry's (efry) *wizremote* server
        (<http://www.beyonwizsoftware.net/software-b28/wizremote>), if it is
        installed in /tmp/config. Otherwise has no effect.

    S99removehacks
        Removes the "/tmp/config/rc.local" and "/tmp/config/usb.local" files
        from the Beyonwiz. For this to be effective, unmodified Beyonwiz
        firmware must be downloaded to the Beyonwiz first. See "DISABLING
        THE HACK".

        This script can also be used in conjunction with the "usb" hack in
        "Beyonwiz::Hack::BwhackSupport" to remove hacks installed by that
        installer.

    The patching process modifies the Beyonwiz firmware startup script
    "/etc/rc.sysinit" to copy the added firmware file "/flash/opt/rc.local"
    into "/tmp/config/rc.local" each time the Beyonwiz starts.
    "/tmp/config/rc.local" is also copied into, and restored from,
    non-volatile storage each time the Beyonwiz restarts. "/etc/rc.sysinit"
    runs after this copy, so modifications to "/tmp/config/rc.local" will be
    overwritten each time the Beyonwiz starts (and before
    "/tmp/config/rc.local" has been run). However, this means that even if
    you install an unmodified firmware package on the beyonwiz, the patch
    will still be active, because running "/tmp/config/rc.local" is part of
    normal firmware startup.

    The effect of this hack will *not* be undone if you load unmodified
    firmware onto the Beyonwiz.

USE IN BW_PATCHER

        Beyonwiz::Hack::USBHackSupport

DISABLING THE HACK

    If the Beyonwiz is not running an unmodified firmware package, download
    unmodified firmware into the Beyonwiz and restart.

    Remove the hacks by restarting the Beyonwiz with a USB device that has
    (at least) "S99removehacks" in "beyonwiz/etc/init.d".

    Then restart the Beyonwiz.

PREPARING THE USB DEVICE OR MEMORY CARD

    The USB device must be formatted as either FAT32 or NTFS.

    Create the directories "beyonwiz", "beyonwiz/etc" and
    "beyonwiz/etc/init.d" (or the equivalent "beyonwiz\etc", etc. if you are
    using Windows).

    Then copy the hack scripts you want to use from "etc/init.d" in this
    package into "beyonwiz/etc/init.d" on the USB device while it's
    connected to your PC (Mac, etc).

    If the device prepared this way is connected to the Beyonwiz at startup,
    the corresponding hacks will be started.

USING THE HACK USB DEVICE OR MEMORY CARD

    To run/start the hacks that you've installed on the USB device (or
    memory card), simply plug the device into an appropriate port on the
    Beyonwiz, and (re)start it.

    If you've included the "S00enablevfd" hack on the device when you set it
    up, the progress of running the hack scripts will be shown on the
    Beyonwiz front panel display.

    If you've included "S08recfixer" on the device, it will display "Fixed
    recording" on the front panel if any recordings were repaired by the
    script. It will also create a fake recording in the recording device's
    "recording" folder called "Fixed_some_broken_recordings" to indicate
    that repairs were made. This recording will be unplayable, but it can be
    deleted.

FOR ADVANCED USERS

    The scripts must be named starting with "S" and two digits, and the
    scripts on any single USB device will be run in numerical order.

    You can temporarily disable a hack on a USB device simply by renaming it
    not to start with "S". It can be reactivated by renaming it to start
    with "S".

    The startup code searches all USB devices connected to the Beyonwiz, and
    runs scripts from any (and all) attached devices with the scripts in the
    appropriate location.

    The USB devices are searched in the following order:

    DP-S1
            Front panel memory card
            Front panel USB port
            Rear USB port

    DP-P1 and DP-H1
            Lower rear USB port
            Upper rear USB port

    If two cards are inserted on the DP-S1 or DP-H1, the search order is
    uncertain, if it works at all.

    If you want to create or modify scripts, you must use an editor that
    respects and preserves Unix-style LF line endings. Many Windows editors
    do not do this. In particular, WordPad will read the files correctly,
    but if you write them, it will convert the line endings to the DOS CRLF
    convention, and they will often fail to work on the Beyonwiz. The CR
    character is *not* treated as whitespace by the Beyonwiz shell.

    You'll need to familiarise yourself with the limited Linux command set
    available on the Beyonwiz, and the fact the command shell on the
    Beyonwiz is much more limited than Linux "bash" and similar.

    Resources on <http://www.OpenWiz.org/> may be useful.

    You can test your scripts by copying them to a Windows Share that the
    Beyonwiz can access, and mounting the share by navigating to the share
    in the file player. You can find where the share is mounted in the
    Beyonwiz file system by running

        mount

FUNCTIONS

    "hack($flash_dir, $root_dir)"
        Called by "bw_patcher" to perform the patch.

        Inserts the lines:

            if [ ! -x /flash/opt/rc.local ]; then
                    rm -f "${CONFIG_DIR}/rc.local"
                    cp /flash/opt/rc.local "${CONFIG_DIR}/rc.local"
            fi

        into the file that will be "/etc/rc.sysinit", the system startup
        script, on the Beyonwiz. The line will be inserted just before the
        comment line:

            # rc.local

        It also adds the new file "/flash/opt/rc.local" to the firmware.
        This file actually implements the hack.

    "hackTag()"
        Returns "usbhack" as the default suffix tag for the patch.

    "printHack()"
        Prints the file that would be installed as "/tmp/config/rc.local" by
        this installer.

        It can be run standalone as:

            perl -MBeyonwiz::Hack::USBHackSupport -e "Beyonwiz::Hack::USBHackSupport::printHack()"

PREREQUSITES

    Uses packages "Beyonwiz::Hack::Utils", "File::Spec::Functions",
    "File::Path".

BUGS

    Using user extensions or hacks may make your Beyonwiz unable to operate
    correctly, or even start. Some modifications are known to interfere with
    the correct functioning of the Beyonwiz.

    If your Beyonwiz cannot start after you load modified firmware, you may
    need to use the procedures in the NOTICE - How to recover from FW update
    failure <http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1298>
    procedure on the Beyonwiz forum. It's not known whether that procedure
    will fix all failures due to user modifications or "hacks".

    If you run modified firmware on your Beyonwiz, and have problems with
    its operation, try to reproduce any problems you do have on a Beyonwiz
    running unmodified firmware, or at least mention the modifications you
    use when reporting the problem to Beyonwiz support or on the Beyonwiz
    Forum <http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/index.php>. Beyonwiz support
    may not be able to assist if you are running anything other than
    unmodified firmware from Beyonwiz. Forum contributers may be able to be
    more flexible, but they will need to know what modifications you have
    made.

    Waits 4 seconds before searching for USB devices. This may occasionally
    not be long enough. If you expect patches to run, and they don't, try
    restarting the Beyonwiz. With the limited scripting facilities
    available, this bug is fifficult to resolve.
