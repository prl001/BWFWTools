        use Beyonwiz::Hack::Utils qw(
            findMatchingPath findNewFile

            insens
        );

SYNOPSIS

    Some functions to help implement patch modules for "Beyonwiz::Hack"
    modules to use in "bw_patcher".

FUNCTIONS

    "insens($insens)"
        Use the case-insensitive encoding of file/directory path names if
        $insens is non-zero, otherwise paths are used as-is.

    "findMatchingPath($fw_dir, $path)"
        Given a directory for the root of an unpacked firmware directory
        tree $fw_dir and a path within it $path, return a list of files that
        match the path in the firmware, taking into account the encoding of
        path names that's done in case-insensitive mode. This is done using
        a file glob, so file name expansion will be done on any file name
        expansion characters in either part of the name. The
        case-insensitive encoding is only done on $path.

        If the returned list contains more than one path, it's up to the
        caller to determine what to do.

    "makeMatchingDirectoryPath($fw_dir, $path)"
        Given a directory for the root of an unpacked firmware directory
        tree $fw_dir and a path within it $path, create a list of
        directories representing the complete path, taking into account any
        case-insensitive name mapping.

        If the returned list contains more than one path, it's up to the
        caller to determine what to do.

    "findNewFile($fw_dir, $path, $exec)"
        Given a directory for the root of an unpacked firmware directory
        tree $fw_dir, a path within it $path and a flag to set whether the
        file should be executable return either a list of matching paths
        found using "findMatchingPath($fw_dir, $path)", or if none match the
        path name of a new file (the file is not created), again taking into
        account the path-name encoding in case-insensitive mode and doing a
        file glob.

    "patchFile($file, $pattern, $patch, $after)"
        Given a $file, a path to an existing file in the firmware (probably
        generated using "findMatchingPath($fw_dir, $path)", add the text in
        the string $patch after ("$after == 1") or before ("$after == 0")
        the line matching the Perl regular expression in $match.

        $patch must have the newlines and any indenting in the correct
        position to "fit" properly in the file; in particular it probably
        should end in a newline.

        Takes some care not to put DOS CRLF line endings in the file.

    "addFile($file, $patch, $exec)"
        Add a new file $file, a path to an existing file in the firmware
        (probably generated using "findMatchingPath($fw_dir, $path)",
        containing the tezt in $patch. The file will be marked as executable
        in the firmware if $exec is non-zero.

        $patch must have the newlines and any indenting in the correct
        position to "fit" properly in the file; in particular it probably
        should end in a newline.

        Takes some care not to put DOS CRLF line endings in the file.

    "pathTildeExpand()"
        Expands "~" and "~"*username* home directory abbreviations in
        $ENV{PATH}. This is needed because Perl "system" and "exec"
        functions don't do tilde expansions.
