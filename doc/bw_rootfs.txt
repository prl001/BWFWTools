NAME

    bw_rootfs - extract or update the root filesystem romfs image in an
    uncompressed Beyonwiz kernel.

SYNOPSIS

        bw_rootfs [-u|--update] [-c|--checkonly] [-f|--force] beyonwiz_uncompressed_kernel [romfs_name]

DESCRIPTION

    Either extract the ROMFS root file system embedded in an uncompressed
    Beyonwiz kernel to *romfs_name*, or update (-u or --update) the existing
    root file system from *romfs_name*.

    When the ROMFS root file system is extracted, the file size is
    zero-padded to the next 1024-byte boundary, for compatibility with
    genromfs and loopback mounting of the ROMFS image on systems that
    support it.

    The size of the update file is limited. The ROMFS image start in the
    kernel is aligned to a 4096-byte boundary, and its size is padded out to
    an integral number of 4096-byte pages. Since the size of the ROMFS image
    itself is an integral number of 16-byte blocks, there is never more than
    4080 (4096 - 16) bytes of spare space in the kernel to accept a larger
    ROMFS image, and there is typically less.

    bw_rootfs prints the location, size, and padded file size for the
    embedded root ROMFS, and the amount of spare space available for an
    update and the maximum size update that -u will accept. It also checks
    that the padding from the end of the ROMFS image to the next page
    boundary is all zero bytes, and prints a warning if it isn't.

    On an update, bw_rootfs will not update the file if the padding check
    fails or if the size of the update is larger than the space available.
    Both these checks can be over-ridden with the -f flag.

    If the -c flag is used, only the checking and information printout is
    performed, the ROMFS image is not extracted, and the kernel is not
    updated. If -c is specified, but -u us not, then the *romfs_name* must
    not be specified; in all other cases it must be present.

ARGUMENTS

    bw_rootfs takes the following arguments:

    update
          -u
          --update

        Normally the ROMFS image contained in *beyonwiz_uncompressed_kernel*
        is extracted into *romfs_name*. When -u is set, the ROMFS image in
        *beyonwiz_uncompressed_kernel* is updated from *romfs_name*, subject
        to the checks described above.

    checkonly
          -c
          --checkonly

        Only print information about the ROMFS image, and perform checks.
        May be used with -u to check whether an update will fit in the
        available space in the kernel.

    force
          -f
          --force

        Ignore the checks for zero-padding and the size of the update and
        perform the operation anyway.

PREREQUSITES

    Uses packages "POSIX", "Getopt::Long" and "Beyonwiz::Kernel".

BUGS

    Using modified firmware on your Beyonwiz may make it unable to operate
    correctly, or even start. Some modifications are known to interfere with
    the correct functioning of the Beyonwiz.

    If your Beyonwiz cannot start after you load modified firmware, you may
    need to use the procedures in the NOTICE - How to recover from FW update
    failure <http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1298>
    procedure on the Beyonwiz forum. It's not known whether that procedure
    will fix all failures due to user modifications or "hacks".

    If you run modified firmware on your Beyonwiz, and have problems with
    its operation, try to reproduce any problems you do have on a Beyonwiz
    running unmodified firmware, or at least mention the modifications you
    use when reporting the problem to Beyonwiz support or on the Beyonwiz
    Forum <http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/index.php>. Beyonwiz support
    may not be able to assist if you are running anything other than
    unmodified firmware from Beyonwiz. Forum contributers may be able to be
    more flexible, but they will need to know what modifications you have
    made.

    Heuristics used to find the embedded ROMFS root filesystem may fail, and
    cause the update or extraction to fail, extract the wrong data or insert
    the update in the wrong location.

    The presumption of 4096-byte page alignment and round-up may be
    incorrect.

    The amount of space available for an update may be small. This isn't
    actually a bug in bw_rootfs, but it is an important limitation.

    Using the -f option may cause the resulting kernel to crash when run in
    a Beyonwiz, requiring the use of the Beyonwiz emergency firmware update
    procedure (<http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1298>)
    which is only supported on a Windows PC.

    If a kernel is updated with a *smaller* ROMFS image than the original,
    that may lose the record of the orignal amount of space allocated to the
    image in the kernel, and may prevent (without the use of -f) a larger
    (but safe) sized ROMFS image from being inserted in the kernel to
    overwrite the smaller one. This is because the only information about
    the allocated space for the ROMFS image is derived from the length field
    in the ROMFS image itself. It is recommended that the -u option only be
    applied to Beyonwiz kernels that have not already been updated using
    bw_rootfs.

    Changing the Beyonwiz root file system may itself result in a firmware
    package that will fail to run correctly, and need the Beyonwiz emergency
    firmware update procedure
    (<http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1298>) to restore
    it, but then if you're doing this I hope you knew that already.
