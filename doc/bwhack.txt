NAME

    bwhack - remotely enable and disable Beyonwiz "hacks"

SYNOPSIS

        bwhack [-H host|--host=host] [-p port|--port=port]
               [-v|--verbose] [-h|help] [ hack1 on hack2 off ...]

DESCRIPTION

    Uses the presence and absence of files on the Beyonwiz HDD to enable or
    disable various user extensions ("hacks") on the Beyonwiz at startup
    time.

    Must be used with a suitable "rc.local" file installed as executable in
    the Beyonwiz "/tmp/config". An example "rc.local" is included in the
    *BWFWTools* package.

    In order to get the file there in the first place, Eric Fry's *Telnet
    patch*
    <http://www.beyonwizsoftware.net/software-b28/telnet-firmware-patch> can
    be used. This only works on specific Beyonwiz firmware versions, but
    once "" is installed on the Beyonwiz, it will not be removed by firmware
    updates, only by a Beyonwiz *Factory Settings* reset.

    Alternatively the "/etc/rc.sysinit" file in any firmware distribution
    can be modified in a similar way to the modification in *Telnet patch*,
    using "unpack_wrp", "pack_wrp" and a suitable editor.

ARGUMENTS

    The main arguments allow the known hacks to be enabled ("on") or
    disabled ("off").

    If no "hack" arguments are given, prints which are enabled and which are
    disbled.

    The known hacks are

    dim The front panel display is run in a dimmer mode (as it is when on
        standby).

    telnetd
        Run *telnetd* to allow login to the Beyonwiz using the *telnet*
        protocol.

    wizremote
        Enable Eric Fry's *wizremote*
        (<http://www.beyonwizsoftware.net/software-b28/wizremote>) on the
        Beyonwiz.

    httproot
        Enable HTTP access to whole BW.

        The Beyonwiz root file system starts at
        "http://your_bw_ip_addr:49152/root". The Beyonwiz HTTP server
        doesn't allow directory listing, so you have to know where you're
        navigating.

    The options to *bwhack* are:

    host
          --host=host
          -H host

        Sets the host name or IP address of the Beyonwiz to connect to.

    port
          --port=port
          -p port

        Sets the IP port number of the Beyonwiz WizPnP/HTTP server to
        connect to. Must match the WizPnP port value set in
        "SETUP>Network>WizPnP" on the Beyonwiz.

    verbose
          --verbose
          -v

        Prints which hacks have been turned on or off.

    help
          --help
          -h

        Prints a summary of the command use.

PREREQUSITES

    Uses packages "Getopt::Long" and "URI", "LWP::Simple" and
    "HTTP::Request".

BUGS

    Requires a suitable startup procedure on the Beyonwiz to work as
    intended. The simplest way of adding one is to use an "rc.local" file
    like the one included in the *BWFWTools* package installed on the
    Beyonwiz in "/tmp/config".

    Using user extensions or hacks may make your Beyonwiz unable to operate
    correctly, or even start. If that happens, you may need to use the
    procedures in NOTICE - How to recover from FW update failure
    <http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1298> procedure on
    the Beyonwiz forum. It's not known whether that procedure will fix all
    failure due to user modifications or "hacks".
