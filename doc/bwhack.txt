NAME

    bwhack - remotely enable and disable Beyonwiz "hacks"

SYNOPSIS

        bwhack [-H host|--host=host] [-p port|--port=port]
               [-v|--verbose] [-h|help] [ hack1 on hack2 off ...]

DESCRIPTION

    Uses the presence and absence of files on the Beyonwiz HDD to enable or
    disable various user extensions ("hacks") on the Beyonwiz at startup
    time.

    Must be used with a suitable "rc.local" file installed as executable in
    the Beyonwiz "/tmp/config". An example "rc.local" is included in the
    *BWFWTools* package.

    In order to get the file there in the first place, Eric Fry's *Telnet
    patch*
    <http://www.beyonwizsoftware.net/software-b28/telnet-firmware-patch> can
    be used. This only works on specific Beyonwiz firmware versions, but
    once "" is installed on the Beyonwiz, it will not be removed by firmware
    updates, only by a Beyonwiz *Factory Settings* reset.

    Alternatively the "/etc/rc.sysinit" file in any firmware distribution
    can be modified in a similar way to the modification in *Telnet patch*,
    using "unpack_wrp", "pack_wrp" and a suitable editor.

ARGUMENTS

    The main arguments allow the known hacks to be enabled ("on") or
    disabled ("off").

    If no "hack" arguments are given, prints which are enabled and which are
    disbled.

    The known hacks are, in execution order:

    dim The front panel display is run in a dimmer mode (as it is when on
        standby).

    telnetd
        Run *telnetd* to allow login to the Beyonwiz using the *telnet*
        protocol.

    wizremote
        Enable Eric Fry's *wizremote*
        (<http://www.beyonwizsoftware.net/software-b28/wizremote>) on the
        Beyonwiz.

    httproot
        Enable HTTP access to whole BW.

        The Beyonwiz root file system starts at
        "http://your_bw_ip_addr:49152/root". The Beyonwiz HTTP server
        doesn't allow directory listing, so you have to know where you're
        navigating.

        *Httproot* does not work (but does not cause any apparent problems)
        on firmware versions 01.05.271 (beta) and newer. The "ln" command
        has been removed from those firmware versions, and without it the
        Beyonwiz cannot create the soft link necessary to impement
        *httproot*.

    usb Enable the use of hacks loaded from a USB drive or memory stick. See
        "Beyonwiz::Hack::USBHackSupport" for details.

    The options to *bwhack* are:

    host
          --host=host
          -H host

        Sets the host name or IP address of the Beyonwiz to connect to.

    port
          --port=port
          -p port

        Sets the IP port number of the Beyonwiz WizPnP/HTTP server to
        connect to. Must match the WizPnP port value set in
        "SETUP>Network>WizPnP" on the Beyonwiz.

    verbose
          --verbose
          -v

        Prints which hacks have been turned on or off.

    help
          --help
          -h

        Prints a summary of the command use.

PREREQUSITES

    Uses packages "Getopt::Long" and "URI", "LWP::Simple" and
    "HTTP::Request".

BUGS

    Using user extensions or hacks may make your Beyonwiz unable to operate
    correctly, or even start. Some modifications are known to interfere with
    the correct functioning of the Beyonwiz.

    If your Beyonwiz cannot start after you load modified firmware, you may
    need to use the procedures in the NOTICE - How to recover from FW update
    failure <http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1298>
    procedure on the Beyonwiz forum. It's not known whether that procedure
    will fix all failures due to user modifications or "hacks".

    If you run modified firmware on your Beyonwiz, and have problems with
    its operation, try to reproduce any problems you do have on a Beyonwiz
    running unmodified firmware, or at least mention the modifications you
    use when reporting the problem to Beyonwiz support or on the Beyonwiz
    Forum <http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/index.php>. Beyonwiz support
    may not be able to assist if you are running anything other than
    unmodified firmware from Beyonwiz. Forum contributers may be able to be
    more flexible, but they will need to know what modifications you have
    made.

    The hack names are displayed on the front panel as they execute.
    Sometimes the last name will remain on the display until the Beyonwiz
    overwrites it. Changing channels will restore the dieplay to normal.

    *Httproot* does not work (but does not cause any apparent problems) on
    firmware versions 01.05.271 (beta) and newer. The "ln" command has been
    removed from those firmware versions, and without it the Beyonwiz cannot
    create the soft link necessary to impement *httproot*.

    Requires a suitable startup procedure on the Beyonwiz to work as
    intended. The simplest way of adding one is to use

        bw_patcher.pl beyonwiz_firmware.wrp patched_firmware.wrp Beyonwiz::Hack::BwhackSupport
