NAME

    dump_strings - extract useful GUI strings from Beyonwiz /dump.dat file

SYNOPSIS

        dump_strings [extracted_GUI_strings_files...]

DESCRIPTION

    Edits the strings extracted from the Beyonwiz "/dump.dat" file,
    eliminating strings that probably aren't GUI messages, and compacting
    the output by removing repeated strings and strings that are substrings
    of other strings.

    Where there are multiple copies of a string the string is tagged with
    "(*)" in the output.

    The intended use is:

        strings dump.dat | dump_strings

PREREQUISITES

    A tool like the Unix strings program that can extract printable strings
    from a binary file.

BUGS

    The filtering is imperfect, and some strings may be included that should
    be excluded, and some excluded that should be included.
