        getDvpStrings directory_containing_beyonwiz_application_firmware

DESCRIPTION

    Edits the strings extracted from the Beyonwiz "getDvpStrings"

    firmware .wrp file.

    The intended use is:

        getDvpStrings 01.05.123.unpacked | dump_strings

PREREQUISITES

    The Unix strings program, and the "gunzip_bflt" program in BWFWTools.

BUGS

    The filtering is imperfect, and some strings may be included that should
    be excluded, and some excluded that should be included.
