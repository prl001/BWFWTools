NAME

    getksyms - extract the kernel module symbol table from an uncompressed
    Beyonwiz kernel

SYNOPSIS

        getksyms [-n|--numeric] beyonwiz_uncompressed_kernel

DESCRIPTION

    Extract the kernel module symbol table from an uncompressed Beyonwiz
    kernel.

    The Beyonwiz kernel contains a symbol table for all the functions and
    data in the kernel module interface (used, for example, for runtime
    loadable device drivers). This tool extracts and prints the symbol table
    from a gunzipped Beyonwiz kernel image.

    The symbols are flagged by t, d and b for the text (executable code),
    initialised data and bss (unitialised data) segments respectively.

ARGUMENTS

    The default is to print the symbols sorted by name. The -n (or
    --numeric) sorts by symbol value.

PREREQUSITES

    Uses packages "Getopt::Long" and "BWFW".

BUGS

    Tries to use some contextual information to ensure that the correct
    values for the location of the symbol table and the segment boundaries
    have been found. These heuristics may fail and the program may produce
    garbage.
