                 firmware_file flash_directory [root_directory]

DESCRIPTION

    Packs the files in *flash_directory*, and optionally in *root_directory*
    into *firmware_file* (Beyonwiz ".wrp" file).

    If the *root_directory* file is given, "linux.bin.gz" in
    *flash_directory* is unzipped and the ROMFS root filesystem constructed
    from *root_directory* is patched into the kernel. See "bw_rootfs" for
    more details.

    The root file system can only be updated if there is enough spare space
    for it in the kernel. There will never be more than 4080 bytes spare,
    usually less. See "bw_rootfs" for more details.

ARGUMENTS

    Pack_wrp takes the following arguments:

    insens
          --insens
          -i

        Packs in a mode that strips a prefix added to file and directory
        names so that files that only differ by the case of the characters
        in their name (eg. "Abc" vs "abc") are guaranteed to remain as
        distinct files. If *flash_directory* and *root_directory* haven't
        been constructed using the case-insensitive modes of "unpack_wrp",
        using this option is likely to result in badly mangled filenames and
        a ".wrp" file that will cause a Beyonwiz to be unbootable.

        This mode is automatically invoked on systems that normally have
        case-insensitive filenames, like Windows, Cygwin and Mac OS X.

    machtype
          --machtype=type
          -t type

        Set the machine type in the ".wrp" firmware file header. *type* must
        be one of s, p or h for the DP-S1, DP-P1 and DP-H1 Beyonwiz models
        respectively.

        If neither *machtype* nor *machcode* is specified, the name of the
        file in *flashdir*"/version" is checked for the machine type, and
        *machtype* is set from that.

        If both *machtype* and *machcode* are set, both corresponding
        options are passed "wiz_pack", and it determines their precedence.

        Setting the wrong type or code for firmware is likely to make the
        Beyonwiz unbootable if the firmware is installed. With this
        interface, you shouldn't have to use *machtype* or *machcode* unless
        the machine type can't be detected automatically.

    machcode
          --machcode=code
          -T code

        Set the 16-digit hexadecimal System ID code
        (<http://www.openwiz.org/wiki/Hardware#System_IDs>) for the
        firmware. Don't use the spaces that appear in the codes on the Web
        page in the argument.

        One of either *machtype* or *machcode* must be specified.

        Setting the wrong type or code for firmware is likely to make the
        Beyonwiz unbootable if the firmware is installed.

        See *machtype* above about the automatic detection of the machine
        type.

    force
          --force
          -f

        Passed through to "bw_rootfs". Forces update of the root file system
        in some cases where it would otherwise fail.

    keep
          --keep
          -k

        When the root file system is constructed, keep the temporary file
        "flash*nnn*" (in "/tmp" on Unix-like systems and "C:\Windows\Temp"
        on Windows).

        "linux.bin" and "root.romfs" in *flash_directory* are deleted
        anyway, so that they aren't packaged into the firmware.

    volname
          --volname=volume
          -V volume

        Set the volume name of the ROMFS file systems. Both the flash and
        the root file systems are given the same name. Defaults to mambo,
        the same as Beyonwiz original firmware.

    version
          --version=version
          -v version

        Set the firmware version string displayed in the firmware
        verification popup on the Beyonwiz when the firmware is downloaded.
        Should be set to something that indicates that the firmware is
        patched!

        Defaults to *xxx.yyy.zzz**suffix* where *xxx.yyy.zzz* is the
        Beyonwiz base version number embedded in the name of the file in
        *flashdir*"/version", if it can be extracted, and *suffix* is a
        suffix to indicate the nature of the repacked firmware. Suffix is
        set by --versionsuffix.

        If no version number can be extracted from *flashdir*"/version", no
        version option is passed to "wiz_pack" and "wiz_pack"'s default
        version number is used.

    versionsuffix
          --versionsuffix=suffix
          -v suffix

        Set the suffix denoting the nature of the repacked firmware to be
        added to an automatically extracted version number, as described
        above in version.

        Defaults to '__wiz_pack'.

    compress
          --compress=level
          -c level

        Set the gzip compression level to *level* when the kernel binary is
        recompressed after an update. The default is to use the gzip default
        compression level if gzip is used for compression, and 9 if the Perl
        "IO::Compress::Gzip" package is used. The Perl package does not
        appear to compress as effectively as gzip, and even at level 9 its
        result is still slightly larger than for gzip's default compression.
        *Level* must be in the range 1..9; 9 for best compression.

        The gzip default is level 6.

        Gzip is only invoked if *root_directory* is specified, otherwise the
        kernel binary is not modified.

    perlgzip, gzip
          --perlgzip
          -p
          --gzip
          -g

        Normally, "pack_wrp" tries to compress the kernel with the GNU
        "gzip" program, then if that fails, by using the Perl
        "IO::Compress::Gzip" library.

        These options force the use of only one of the two compression
        mechanisms.

PREREQUSITES

    Uses packages "Getopt::Long", "IO::Compress::Gzip",
    "IO::Uncompress::Gunzip" and "FindBin".

    Uses "bw_rootfs".

    Uses Eric Fry's wizfwtools programs "wiz_pack" and "wiz_genromfs".

    Tries GNU "gzip", "IO::Compress::Gzip" to compress the kernel image
    unless one of --perlgzip or --gzip is used.

BUGS

    Using *pack_wrp* (or any other method) to create a modified version of
    the firmware for any Beyonwiz model can result in a firmware package
    that can cause the Beyonwiz firmware to fail completely.

    Tries to use some contextual information to find the root filesystem.
    They may fail and the updating of the root file system will fail.

    Because of the way the root file system is patched into the kernel, if
    you want to make *other* patches to the kernel and update the root
    filesystem, you have to ungzip "linux.bin.gz", make the patches, and
    then regzip the kernel. If you patch "linux.bin" and don't gzip it back
    into "linux.bin.gz" those changes will be lost in the three-argument
    form of "pack_wrp".

    Using high compression levels for the kernel file is not yet tested.

    Has too many options.
