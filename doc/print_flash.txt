NAME

    print_flash - extract the memory file device data from an uncompressed
    Beyonwiz kernel

SYNOPSIS

        print_flash beyonwiz_uncompressed_kernel

DESCRIPTION

    Extract the memory file device data from an uncompressed Beyonwiz
    kernel.

    The memory device arena containing the location of complete memory
    devices and the MTD (Memory Technology Device) table, which contains the
    partitions of the Beyonwiz flash memory are decoded and printed.

    Sizes with the notation "From ROMFS" indicate that the size of the
    device is taken from the header of the ROMFS file system that the device
    contains.

    Useful for checking the size of the flash memory device in a Beyonwiz
    (or at least the size the kernel expects it to be).

ARGUMENTS

    The only argument is the name of an uncompressed Beyonwiz kernal.

PREREQUSITES

    Uses package "Beyonwiz::Kernel".

BUGS

    Tries to use some contextual information to ensure that the correct
    values for the location of the symbol table and the segment boundaries
    have been found. These heuristics may fail and the program may produce
    garbage.
