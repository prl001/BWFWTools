NAME

    svcdat - print the contents of Beyonwiz "svc.dat" (service scan
    configuration) files

SYNOPSIS

        svcdat svc.dat_files...

DESCRIPTION

    Prints or dumps the tables in Beyonwiz "svc.dat" files. Normal listing
    is of the decoded service table, channel table and (assumed) tuner
    parameter table grouped by channel, then by service. The columns marked
    as PMT PID and PCR PID have not been confirmed as the PIDs for the
    service Program Map Table and Program Clock Reference. The (presumed)
    tuner parameters are indicated as "T1(...) T2(...)" for the two tuners.

    The option -d does a hexadecimal dump of the tables as 16-bit
    little-endian integers. The columns are headed by the interpretation of
    the values.

PREREQUSITES

    Uses package "Getopt::Long".

BUGS

    There are parts of the "svc.dat" file whose function is unknown. The T1
    and T2 parameters are believed to relate to the tuners, but that's
    uncertain, and the meaning of the parameters is unknown.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    Most of the "svc.dat" interpretation was done by efry (Eric Fry) and
    tonymy01 (Tony) on the Australian Beyonwiz Forum
    (<http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/index.php>).
