NAME

    unpack_wrp - unpack a Beyonwiz firmware update file

SYNOPSIS

        unpack_wrp [-i|--insens] [-f|--force] [-k|--keep] firmware_file flash_directory [root_directory]

DESCRIPTION

    Extracts the files in *firmware_file* (Beyonwiz ".wrp" file) into the
    directory *flash_directory* as they would appear in the Beyonwiz's
    "/flash" directory. If the *root_directory* argument is also given, the
    Beyonwix root file system is extracted from the kernel image in "/flash"
    into that directory.

    The two-argument form does not hve any more functionality than Eric
    Fry's "wiz_unpack".

ARGUMENTS

    Make_kernel_bflt takes the following arguments:

    insens
          --insens
          -i

        Extracts in a mode that adds a prefix to file and directory names so
        that files that only differ by the case of the characters in their
        name (eg. "Abc" vs "abc") are kept as distinct files.

        This mode is automatically invoked on systems that normally have
        case-insensitive filenames, like Windows, Cygwin and Mac OS X.

    force
          --force
          -f

        Passed through to "bw_rootfs". Forces extraction in some cases where
        it would otherwise fail.

    keep
          --keep
          -k

        When the root file system is extracted, keep the files "linux.bin"
        and "root.romfs", which are otherwise deleted.

PREREQUSITES

    Uses packages "Getopt::Long", "File::Spec::Functions",
    "IO::Uncompress::Gunzip" and "FindBin".

    Uses "bw_rootfs".

    Uses Eric Fry's wizfwtools program wiz_unpack.

BUGS

    Tries to use some contextual information to find the root filesystem.
    They may fail and the extraction of the root file system will fail.
