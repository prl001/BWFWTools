        The example is for firmware release 1.05.197.

        The output fields are:

        fileSize

        Size of the .wrp file.

        offset

        Offset of the start of the header in the file.

        magic

        The magic string that indicates that the file is a Beyonwiz firmware
        update. Should always be "WizFwPkgl".

        machMagic

        The magic number that corresponds to the Beyonwiz System ID for the
        device. Used to ensure that the firmware is for the correct type of
        device.

        model

        Beyonwiz model designation (DP-S1, etc.) derived from "machMagic".
        "Unknown" if a match is not found for the "machMagic".

        version

        The version string that is printed in the verification popup window
        on the beyonwiz when the firmware is uploaded for verification.

        md5file

        Checksum over the file, with this field set to zeros.

        count

        Count of the remaining payloads to process. This interpretation is
        uncertain. The value has only ever been observed to be 1.

        imageTag

        Uncertain interpretation. Has always been observed to be [108, 32].

        imageType

        Type of firmware payload.

          0 - None
          1 - Boot loader
          2 - ROMFS
          3 - Splash Screen
          4 - Release Note

        Has only been observed to have value 2.

        imageOffset

        Offset of the start of the payload for this header.

        imageLength

        Length of the payload. The actual file alloction for the payload
        appears to be rounded up to an even multiple of 1024 bytes, as
        *floor*((imageLength + 1023) / 1024 ) * 1024. A zero-filled header
        block follows this allocated space as an empty header to indicate
        the end of the package.

        spaceRemaining

        The amount of free space remaining in the flash memory after loading
        the firmware. The flash memory size is determined from "machMagic".
        "Unknown" if a match is not found for the "machMagic".

        md5image

        MD5 checksum of the payload (over exactly the given length).

        fsType

        Payload file system type. Only -rom1fs- for a Linux ROMFS file
        system has been observed.

        fsSize

        File system size. For ROMFS file systems always an integer multiple
        of 16.

        fsVol

        File system volume label.

PREREQUISITES

    Uses package "Beyonwiz::SystemId".

BUGS

    The interpretation of some parts of the header is uncertain.

    The roundup for the allocation of the payload is uncertain.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    Most of the header interpretation was done by efry (Eric) on the
    Australian Beyonwiz Forum
    (<http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/index.php>).

POD ERRORS

    Hey! The above document had some coding errors, which are explained
    below:

    Around line 44:
        You can't have =items (as at line 50) unless the first thing after
        the =over is an =item
