<p>bw_rootfs - extract or update the root filesystem romfs image in an
uncompressed Beyonwiz kernel.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<pre>
    bw_rootfs [-u|--update] [-c|--checkonly] [-f|--force] beyonwiz_uncompressed_kernel [romfs_name]</pre>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>Either extract the ROMFS root file system embedded in an uncompressed
Beyonwiz kernel to <em>romfs_name</em>, or update (<strong>-u</strong> or <strong>--update</strong>)
the existing root file system from <em>romfs_name</em>.</p>
<p>When the ROMFS root file system is extracted, the file size is zero-padded
to the next 1024-byte boundary, for compatibility with genromfs and loopback
mounting of the ROMFS image on systems that support it.</p>
<p>The size of the update file is limited. The ROMFS image start in the kernel is
aligned to a 4096-byte boundary, and its size is padded out to an integral
number of 4096-byte pages. Since the size of the ROMFS image itself is an
integral number of 16-byte blocks, there is never more than
4080 (4096 - 16) bytes of spare space in the kernel to accept a larger
ROMFS image, and there is typically less.</p>
<p><strong>bw_rootfs</strong> prints the location, size, and padded file size for the
embedded root ROMFS, and the amount of spare space
available for an update and the maximum size update that <strong>-u</strong> will accept.
It also checks that the padding from the end of the ROMFS image to the
next page boundary is all zero bytes, and prints a warning if it isn't.</p>
<p>On an update, <strong>bw_rootfs</strong> will not update the file if the padding check fails
or if the size of the update is larger than the space available. Both
these checks can be over-ridden with the <strong>-f</strong> flag.</p>
<p>If the <strong>-c</strong> flag is used, only the checking and information printout
is performed, the ROMFS image is not extracted, and the kernel is not updated.
If <strong>-c</strong> is specified, but <strong>-u</strong> us not, then the <em>romfs_name</em> must not be
specified; in all other cases it must be present.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="arguments">ARGUMENTS</a></h1>
<p><strong>bw_rootfs</strong> takes the following arguments:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_update">update</a></strong>

<dd>
<pre>
  -u
  --update</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Normally the ROMFS image contained in <em>beyonwiz_uncompressed_kernel</em>
is extracted into <em>romfs_name</em>.
When <strong>-u</strong> is set, the ROMFS image in <em>beyonwiz_uncompressed_kernel</em>
is updated from <em>romfs_name</em>, subject to the checks described above.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="item_checkonly">checkonly</a></strong>

<dd>
<pre>
  -c
  --checkonly</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Only print information about the ROMFS image, and perform checks.
May be used with <strong>-u</strong> to check whether an update will fit in the available
space in the kernel.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="item_force">force</a></strong>

<dd>
<pre>
  -f
  --force</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Ignore the checks for zero-padding and the size of the update
and perform the operation anyway.</p>
</dd>

<h1><a name="bugs">BUGS</a></h1>
<p><strong>Using modified firmware on your Beyonwiz may make it unable to
operate correctly, or even start.
Some modifications are known to interfere with the correct
functioning of the Beyonwiz.</strong></p>
<p>If your Beyonwiz cannot start after you load modified firmware,
you may need to use the procedures in the
<strong>NOTICE - How to recover from FW update failure</strong>
<a href="http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1298">http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php</a>
procedure on the Beyonwiz forum.
It's not known whether that procedure will fix all 
failures due to user modifications or ``hacks''.</p>
<p>If you run modified firmware on your Beyonwiz, and have
problems with its operation, try to reproduce
any problems you do have on a Beyonwiz running unmodified firmware,
or at least mention the modifications you use when reporting the
problem to Beyonwiz support or on the Beyonwiz Forum
<a href="http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/index.php">http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/index.php</a>.
Beyonwiz support may not be able to assist if you are running anything
other than unmodified firmware from Beyonwiz.
Forum contributers may be able to be more flexible, but they will
need to know what modifications you have made.</p>
<p>Heuristics used to find the embedded ROMFS root filesystem may fail,
and cause the update or extraction to fail, extract the wrong data or
insert the update in the wrong location.</p>
<p>The presumption of 4096-byte page alignment and round-up may be incorrect.</p>
<p>The amount of space available for an update may be small.  This isn't
actually a bug in <strong>bw_rootfs</strong>, but it is an important limitation.</p>
<p>Using the <strong>-f</strong> option may cause the resulting kernel to crash when
run in a Beyonwiz, requiring the use of the
Beyonwiz emergency firmware update procedure
(<a href="http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1298">http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php</a>)
which is only supported on a Windows PC.</p>
<p>If a kernel is updated with a <em>smaller</em> ROMFS image than the original,
that may lose the record of the orignal amount of space allocated to
the image in the kernel, and may prevent (without the use of <strong>-f</strong>) a
larger (but safe) sized ROMFS image from being inserted in the kernel
to overwrite the smaller one. This is because the only information about
the allocated space for the ROMFS image is derived from the length field
in the ROMFS image itself.
It is recommended that the <strong>-u</strong> option only be applied to Beyonwiz
kernels that have not already been updated using <strong>bw_rootfs</strong>.</p>
<p>Changing the Beyonwiz root file system may itself result in a firmware
package that will fail to run correctly, and need the 
Beyonwiz emergency firmware update procedure
(<a href="http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1298">http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php</a>)
to restore it, but then if you're doing this
I hope you knew that already.</p>
